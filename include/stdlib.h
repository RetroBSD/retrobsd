 * Adapted from the 4.4-Lite CD.  The odds of a ANSI C compiler for 2.11BSD
 * being slipped under the door are not distinguishable from 0 - so the
 * prototypes and ANSI ifdefs have been removed from this file.
 *
 * Some functions (strtoul for example) do not exist yet but are retained in
 * this file because additions to libc.a are anticipated shortly.
