 *
 * Copied from 4.4-Lite and modified for 2.11BSD.  The modifications consisted
 * of removing: function prototypes (I don't like them, the compiler does not
 * support them, and it would mean dragging in cdefs.h to leave them in here),
 * #ifndef _POSIX_SOURCE lines (silly) and record locking related definitions
 * If anyone adds any of the above it will be easy enough to modify this file.
 * In the meantime why bog down (or blow up) cpp any further?
