## Build

To compile everything from sources, you'll need some packages installed, namely:
Berkeley YACC, GNU bison, flex, groff, ELF library and FUSE library.
Under Ubuntu, for example, you can do it by command:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install bison byacc flex groff-base libelf-dev
```

You can change a desired filesystem size and swap area size, as required.
Default is:
```Makefile
FS_MBYTES   = 100
SWAP_MBYTES = 2
```
To compile the kernel and build a filesystem image, run:

```shell
$ make -j1
```

A resulting root filesystem image is in file `sdcard.img`.
A kernel is in file `unix.hex` in your target board subdirectory.


### Filesystem image

You need to put a filesystem image on a SD card.  On Windows, use
Win32DiskImager utility (https://launchpad.net/win32-image-writer/+download).
On Linux, run:

```shell
$ sudo dd if=sdcard.img of=/dev/XYZ
```

Here `XYZ` is a device name of SD card, as recognized by Linux (sdb in my case).


### Install kernel

Kernel image should be written to PIC32 flash memory.  The procedure depends
on a board used.

#### Max32 board:
Use a pic32prog utility (http://code.google.com/p/pic32prog/)
and a USB cable to install a kernel:

```shell
$ pic32prog -d /dev/ttyUSB0 sys/pic32/max32/unix.hex
```

Here you need to change AVRTOOLS path and tty name according to your system.

#### UBW32 board:
Use a pic32prog utility (http://code.google.com/p/pic32prog/)
and a USB cable to install a kernel:

```shell
$ pic32prog sys/pic32/ubw32/unix.hex
```

#### Maximite:
Use the bootload program for Windows, available for download by link:
http://geoffg.net/Downloads/Maximite/Maximite_Update_V2.7B.zip

#### Explorer 16 board:
There is an auxiliary PIC18 chip on the Explorer 16 board, which can be
used as a built-in programmer device.  You will need a PICkit 2 adapter
to install a needed firmware, as described in article:
http://www.paintyourdragon.com/?p=51
(section "Hack #2: Lose the PICkit 2, Save $35").
This should be done only once.

Then, you can use a pic32prog utility (http://code.google.com/p/pic32prog/)
and a USB cable to install a kernel:

``` shell
$ pic32prog sys/pic32/explorer16/unix.hex
```

#### PIC32 Starter Kit:
Use PICkit 2 adapter and software to install a boot loader from
file `sys/pic32/starter-kit/boot.hex`.  This should be done only once.

Then, you can use a pic32prog utility (http://code.google.com/p/pic32prog/)
and a USB cable to install a kernel:

```shell
$ pic32prog sys/pic32/starter-kit/unix.hex
```


## Simulator

You can use a MIPS32 simulator to develop a debug a RetroBSD software,
without a need for hardware board.  By default, a simulator is configured
to imitate a Max32 board.  To build it:

```shell
$ cd tools/virtualmips
$ make
```

Run it:

```shell
$ ./pic32
```

Configuration of simulated board is stored in file `pic32_max32.conf`.
