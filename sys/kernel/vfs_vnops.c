 * 2.11BSD does not have "vnodes", having instead only old fashioned "inodes".
 * The routine names (i.e. vn_open) were retained since the functions them-

 * names also makes it easier to follow the logic flow when reading the 4.4
 * sources.  Also, changing the names from vn_* to in_* could have caused
 * confusion with the networking routines since 'in_' and 'ip_' are frequently
