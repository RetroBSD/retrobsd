 * This has been slightly trimmed from the 4.4BSD version for use with 2.11BSD.
 * In particular 1) the flag names were changed back to the original ones
 * since I didn't feel like porting all of 4.4's stdio package right now and
 * 2) The constant BUFSIZ is used rather than importing the "optimum buffer
 * size selection" logic from 4.4 (besides, a PDP11 can't afford more than 1kb
 * most of the time anyhow).
