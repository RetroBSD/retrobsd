  Function:

  Summary:
    This function is the main state machine of the USB device side stack.
    This function should be called periodically to receive and transmit
    packets through the stack. This function should be called preferably
    once every 100us during the enumeration process. After the enumeration
    process this function still needs to be called periodically to respond
    to various situations on the bus but is more relaxed in its time
    requirements. This function should also be called at least as fast as
    the OUT data expected from the PC.

  Description:
    This function is the main state machine of the USB device side stack.
    This function should be called periodically to receive and transmit
    packets through the stack. This function should be called preferably
    once every 100us during the enumeration process. After the enumeration
    process this function still needs to be called periodically to respond
    to various situations on the bus but is more relaxed in its time
    requirements. This function should also be called at least as fast as
    the OUT data expected from the PC.

    Typical usage:
    <code>
    void main(void)
    {
        usb_device_init();
        while (1)
        {
            usb_device_tasks();

                // so we don't want to do execute any application code
                continue;   //go back to the top of the while loop

    This function should be called preferably once every 100us during the

    needs to be called periodically to respond to various situations on the
    bus but is more relaxed in its time requirements.

    1), then it should not send a remote wakeup command to the PC and this
    function is not of any use to the device. If a device does support
    remote wakeup then it should use this function as described below.

    If this function returns FALSE and the device is suspended, it should
    not issue a remote wakeup (resume).

    If this function returns TRUE and the device is suspended, it should
    issue a remote wakeup (resume).

    A device can add remote wakeup support by having the _RWU symbol added
    in the configuration descriptor (located in the usb_descriptors.c file
    in the project). This done in the 8th byte of the configuration
    descriptor. For example:

    <code lang="c">
    const unsigned char configDescriptor1[]={
        0x09,                           // Size
        USB_DESCRIPTOR_CONFIGURATION,   // descriptor type
        DESC_CONFIG_WORD(0x0022),       // Total length
        1,                              // Number of interfaces
        1,                              // Index value of this cfg
        0,                              // Configuration string index
        _DEFAULT | _SELF | _RWU,        // Attributes, see usb_device.h
        50,                             // Max power consumption in 2X mA(100mA)

        //The rest of the configuration descriptor should follow
    </code>

    to the usb_device_tasks() function as possible while the this function
    \returns any value between ATTACHED_STATE through CONFIGURED_STATE.

 Summary:
   This call back is invoked when a wakeup from USB suspend
   is detected.

 Description:
   The host may put USB peripheral devices in low power
   suspend mode (by "sending" 3+ms of idle).  Once in suspend
   mode, the host may wake the device back up by sending non-
   idle state signalling.

   This call back is invoked when a wakeup from USB suspend

   If clock switching or other power savings measures were taken when
   executing the usbcb_suspend() function, now would be a good time to
   switch back to normal full power run mode conditions.  The host allows
   a few milliseconds of wakeup time, after which the device must be
   fully back to normal, and capable of receiving and processing USB
   packets.  In order to do this, the USB module must receive proper
   clocking (IE: 48MHz clock must be available to SIE for full speed USB
   operation).

    Typically, user firmware does not need to do anything special

    packet to your device, but the packet gets corrupted (ex:
    because of a bad connection, or the user unplugs the
    USB cable during the transmission) this will typically set
    one or more USB error interrupt flags.  Nothing specific
    needs to be done however, since the SIE will automatically
    send a "NAK" packet to the host.  In response to this, the
    host will normally retry to send the packet again, and no
    data loss occurs.  The system will typically recover
    automatically, without the need for application firmware
    intervention.

  Summary:

/*
  Function:
        void usbcb_send_resume (void)

  Summary:
    This function should be called to initiate a remote wakeup. (optional)
  Description:
    The USB specifications allow some types of USB peripheral devices to
    wake up a host PC (such as if it is in a low power suspend to RAM
    state). This can be a very useful feature in some USB applications,
    such as an Infrared remote control receiver. If a user presses the
    "power" button on a remote control, it is nice that the IR receiver can
    detect this signalling, and then send a USB "command" to the PC to wake
    up.

    The usbcb_send_resume() "callback" function is used to send this special
    USB signalling which wakes up the PC. This function may be called by
    application firmware to wake up the PC. This function should only be
    called when:

      1. The USB driver used on the host PC supports the remote wakeup
         capability.
      2. The USB configuration descriptor indicates the device is remote
         wakeup capable in the bmAttributes field. (see usb_descriptors.c and
         _RWU)
      3. The USB host PC is currently sleeping, and has previously sent
         your device a SET FEATURE setup packet which "armed" the remote wakeup
         capability. (see usb_get_remote_wakeup_status())

    This callback should send a RESUME signal that has the period of
    1-15ms.

    Typical Usage:
    <code>
    if ((usb_device_state == CONFIGURED_STATE)
        &amp;&amp; usb_is_device_suspended()
        &amp;&amp; (usb_get_remote_wakeup_status() == TRUE))
    {
        if (ButtonPressed)
        {
            // Wake up the USB module from suspend
            usb_wake_from_suspend();

            // Issue a remote wakeup command on the bus
            usbcb_send_resume();
        }
    }
    </code>
  Conditions:
    None
  Remarks:
    A user can switch to primary first by calling usbcb_wake_from_suspend() if
    required/desired.

    The modifiable section in this routine should be changed to meet the
    application needs. Current implementation temporary blocks other
    functions from executing for a period of 1-13 ms depending on the core
    frequency.

    According to USB 2.0 specification section 7.1.7.7, "The remote wakeup
    device must hold the resume signaling for at lest 1 ms but for no more
    than 15 ms." The idea here is to use a delay counter loop, using a
    common value that would work over a wide range of core frequencies.
    That value selected is 1800. See table below:
    <table>
    Core Freq(MHz)   MIP (for PIC18)   RESUME Signal Period (ms)
    ---------------  ----------------  --------------------------
    48               12                1.05
    4                1                 12.6

      * These timing could be incorrect when using code optimization or
        extended instruction mode, or when having other interrupts enabled.
        Make sure to verify using the MPLAB SIM's Stopwatch and verify the
        actual signal on an oscilloscope.
      * These timing numbers should be recalculated when using PIC24 or
        PIC32 as they have different clocking structures.
      * A timer can be used in place of the blocking loop if desired.
